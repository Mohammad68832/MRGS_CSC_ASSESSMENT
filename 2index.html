<h2>What is Kaitiakitanga & Manaakitanga?</h2>
<p>
  Kaitiakitanga is a very important Maori concept that often means a lot to the people and their culture. It is a concept
  that encompasses all aspects of nature, including the lands, skies, and seas, and highlights how important they are to
  the people and how they can be conserved with the right mindset. Kaitiakitanga is a Maori word that means guardianship
  and protection, and is often used to link to the protection and conservation of native flora and fauna. Kaitiakitanga
  is not just about managing resources, but also maintaining a balance between the people and nature. The Māori people were
  quite advanced in their methods and understood nature very well, being able to use certain parts of nature when they needed
  it, and banning the usage of the area for material for a while for it to recover. In conclusion, kaitiakitanga is an old
  Maori practice that concerns the guardianship and protection of the land and sea that surrounds it.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Manaakitanga is another very important Maori concept that often relates to respect, responsibility and care in our modern
  society. However, if taken seriously and applied to every aspect of life, it could also be applied to things like nature.
  If we were to respect our nature, it would be easier to incorporate practises like Kaitiakitanga, and would make it easier
  to protect, care, and preserve our environment for future generations. Similar goes for responsibility, if we were all to
  take responsibility for our own actions and for our environment, it would be much easier for us and environmental workers
  to apply kaitiakitanga into our environments. And finally, if we were actually to care about nature and our exotic plant
  and wildlife, we wouldn’t even need to take all the precautionary actions that are being applied currently. This means
  that together, along with kaitiakitanga, if carried by every person in their hearts, can destroy pollution and any other
  things that are currently helping to destroy our environments.
