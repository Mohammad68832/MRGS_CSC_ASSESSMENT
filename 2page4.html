            <h2>How would Kaitiakitanga benefit the land and decrease the amount of pollution caused by common practices?</h2>
            <p>
                Kaitiakitanga often benefits the land greatly, as it is used to control the amount of material that we use and
                ensure that we do not damage the environment in any way, and to protect it and guard it so that it can be
                passed on to future generations. Pollution is one of the many problems that hinders the efforts of the
                guardians of our lands, this is as it introduces dangerous and unwanted substances into our environment, which
                damage the health of our animal and plant life. Kaitiakitanga is a concept that would benefit our lands and
                decrease the amount of pollution as if it were adapted, it would change the focus of humanity off from things
                like luxury and money, and would bring focus back to the things that matter like protecting our lands and seas,
                so that all of our future generations would be able to enjoy it. By incorporating things like Manaakitanga
                into our lives, Kaitiakitanga would actually be able to become a reality instead of being some distant and
                unbelievable practice. This would require global cooperation, sustainable practices, waste reduction, and
                increased awareness to protect land and marine ecosystems for future generations. If we were to all unite,
                we would be able to overcome pollution and any of the other things that would destroy our environment.
