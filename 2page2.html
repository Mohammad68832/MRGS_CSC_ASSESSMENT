        At Mount Roskill Grammar School, we deeply treasure our commitment to environmental care, reflecting the Māori
        concepts of Kaitiakitanga and Manaakitanga, which focus on protection, care, and respect. We aim to foster a
        community in Mt Roskill that is sustainable, environmentally friendly, and enriches the cultural connection with
        the local ecosystem.

    <h2><b>What is Pollution?</b></h2>
    <p>
        Pollution is the introduction of unwanted and dangerous substances into our environment, damaging natural ecosystems,
        the health of organisms, and destroying or diminishing natural resources. There are many types of pollution,
        including air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, and noise pollution. From these diverse types, soil
        and water have a significant impact on the Earth's animal populations, as they destroy the homes and habitats of
        these animals, disrupting the balance of the ecosystem. While land pollution often stems from the improper disposal
        of waste, the use of pesticides and fertilisers, industrial activities, and deforestation, water pollution most
        often stems from pollutants such as plastics, oil spills, chemicals, and untreated sewage that enter oceans.
        Land and water pollution are often interrelated; land pollution often seeps into the soil and eventually finds
        its way to waterways like rivers, lakes, and sewage systems, eventually reaching the ocean. From the ocean, it
        is absorbed into the rainwater and finds its way onto land again. This cycle exacerbates the damage to our homes
        and threatens our planet's health. In order to address pollution, it requires global cooperation and contributions,
        the introduction of sustainable practices, reducing waste, and increased awareness to protect land and marine
        ecosystems for future generations.

          <h3>Effects of Land Pollution</h3>
          <p style="color: black;">Land pollution is the slow deterioration of Earth's crust, above and below ground level.
            Land pollution not only damages the health of plants and animal life, but also affects us and everything around us.
            Land pollution is caused by unsustainable cultural practices, like water wastage and careless fertiliser usage.
            Another is the improper disposal of waste, like littering and misplacing trash. The last, most potent one is
            the mining of dangerous substances. These altogether mix to create horrible and irreversible damage to our
            planet and its atmosphere. They destroy waterways, pollute soil, and endanger all the species of Earth.

          <h3>Effects of Ocean Pollution</h3>
          <p style="color: black;">Water Pollution is when water is contaminated, corrupting the water quality and rendering
              the body of water unfit for human or animal consumption or use. Water pollution is often caused when harmful
              substances enter and contaminate our waterways. These harmful substances could be things like chemicals
              released into the oceans through nuclear power plants, and other plants. It could also come in the form of
              fertilisers released through the soil and find its way into lakes, ponds, and other bodies of water. And the
              most obvious and dangerous one, plastic pollution. When plastic pollution enters our water bodies, they are
              often eaten by sea creatures, causing them to choke and die. These together destroy waterways and pollute
              them, filling them with dangerous substances and plastics that can kill the undersea ecosystems.
