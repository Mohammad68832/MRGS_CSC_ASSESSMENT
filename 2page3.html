    <p>Since the 1950’s, statisticians have been recording the amount of pollution in our environment per decade. Due to
        “Our World In Data”, we can analyse the statistics and effects of pollution

            <p style="color: black">
                The production of plastic is defined as the sum of all plastics produced over a specific period of time.
                As such, it is measured in all plastics produced per decade.

        <div class="box">
            <p style="color: black">
                Plastic waste that flows into the ocean, damages the environment and kills the animals. In 2019, the global
                rate was around 6 million tonnes of plastic waste emitted into the ocean.  This is roughly 1.3% of plastics
                produced in that year. This then accelerates even more per year , with about 15 million tonnes of plastic
                entering the ocean each year.

            <p style="color: black">
                Throughout history,  the ocean has been a very important treasure that it was very important to take care
                of. It was for food, relaxation, transportation, and many other things. However, nowadays it is used as
                a dumping ground for all our waste plastics. This is one of the many things that shows  the contrast
                between our respect for the environment in the past, and in the present.
